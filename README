/** @mainpage impd4e - Internet Measurement Probe for Embedded Devices

This package contains a small network probe which allows to monitor and 
sample datagrams from the network. Based on the hash-based selection algorithm (cf. [RFC5475])
the selected datagrams will be the same on every point in the network.
Hash-based packet selection takes parts of the packet as the input for a hash function. 
In case the hash value falls into a predefined selection range the packet is selected. 
In case selection range, hash function, and the inout for the hash function is the same, the selection
on every node will be the same.  

The measurement probe exports packet IDs and relevant information viai the standardized IPFIX protocol. 
 
The impd4e tool exports the following fields via IPFIX depending on the
use of the -t parameter. See templates.h for details.

This package makes use of the Fraunhofer FOKUS "libipfix" library which
must be installed prior to compilation of impd4e.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/libipfix/ (make sure to use the impd4e version)

This package also requires libev, which can be downloaded from
http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/

You can download the latest version of impd4e from:
