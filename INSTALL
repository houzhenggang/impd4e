prerequisites:
- libpcap (including libpcap-dev package)
- libipfix (get it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libipfix/ - make sure to use the impd4e Version)
- libev (http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/)


0. install libpcap

on a debian or Ubuntu system for example simply run

sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

1. get or build libev

either install "libev-dev" using your distribution's packet manager or 

get libev tarball from http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/ 

tar xvzf libev....tgz
./configure
make
sudo make install

2. build libipfix

get the libipfix tar archive (the impd4e Version) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libipfix/
unpack, compile and install it
tar xvzf libipfix-impd4e.tgz
./configure
make
sudo make install

3. build impd4e

in your local impd4e folder run
./configure
make
sudo make install   (this will install impd4e to /usr/local/bin/ by default)

4. quick test run of impd4e

cd libipfix/collector
./ipfix_collector

in another shell run the probe:
sudo impd4e -i eth0 

To listen to the ethernet interface you will probably need to be root, run "sudo su" before starting the impd4e tool.

If starting impd4e results in an error like this:
"impd4e: error while loading shared libraries: libev.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
then you need to add /usr/local/lib to your library path, e.g. if your shell is bash then edit ~/.bashrc and add

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH$:/usr/local/lib

at the end of it. (for running impd4e as user root make sure to edit root's .bashrc file!)

5. Usage

Use the help option: ipmd4e -h
