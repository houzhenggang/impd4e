prerequisites:
- libpcap (including libpcap-dev package)
- libipfix (get it from https://sourceforge.net/projects/libipfix/ - make sure to use the impd4e Version)
- libev (http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/)

To build impd4e, run "./configure" (a shell script). The configure
script will determine your system attributes and generate
appropriate makefiles from Makefile.in. Next run "make". If everything
goes well you can run "make install". 

example:
          ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
          make
          make install
          sudo make install   (this will install impd4e to /usr/local/bin/ by default)

example usage:

	  at first compile the libipfix, including make install

	  to run an IPFIX collector start ipfix_collector from the collector subdir of libipfix

	  to run the impd4e execute for example 
		ipmd4e -h
		impd4e -i eth0 -C collector_host -P collector_port -f <bpf-filter> -F BOB -r 10

To listen to the ethernet interface you will probably need to be root, run "sudo su" before starting the impd4e tool.

Make sure that the user root has /usr/local/lib in his library path. For bash set it with
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH$:/usr/local/lib
before starting impd4e
